# A live message wall

```
Build a web application called "Wall" where visitors can leave a message that gets instantly published on the wall for others to see.

The wall displays the messages from newest to oldest, and updates lives as new messages are added.

Users do not need to log in.
Messages cannot be removed.
Users do not provide any identification information when adding a message, only the message itself.

The website UI is extremely simplistic, resembling a typical text-mode console, it looks like it was a modern TUI like those in claude code and opencode, using a console-like, small font, a dark theme and a text-only, ASCII inspired interface.

There is a top, slim, sticky bar that contains the input for the user to enter its message and the "Add to wall" button. The rest of the screen is devoted to display the wall itself.

Messages on the wall have a fixed size, and the text is cropped if it does not fit into the message card. When clicked, a model opens to let the user read the entire message.

Messages on the wall are displayed from top to bottom and left to right, just like the text flow of newspapers, filling the entire available screen, and scrolling horizontally when there are more messages than the screen can fit.

Add a README.md file that documents the application and its technical structure.

## Additional prompts

```
Prevent users from flooding the wall, for example, by not allowing the same user to add a message if they already added one in the last hour.
```

```
Add a couple thousand random messages for testing.
Make the wall lazy loading, so it only loads the first N messages at first, and loads more automatically as the user scrolls to the right.
